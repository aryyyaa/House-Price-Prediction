# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a Python implementation for predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical features are encoded appropriately. The model is built and evaluated using the scikit-learn library.
The model is built using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values using SimpleImputer.
Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Linear Regression model using the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using the test set.
Print training and test set scores along with sample predictions.
